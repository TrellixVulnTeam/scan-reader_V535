# Scan-Reader



Scan reader is an opensource project developped by Lukihd.
**I do could not be responsible of how people use my program.**



This project is developped in Python so you need at least python 3 to use it.
If some file is not downloaded it’s probably the url that is bad. Please check it before asking me.

Next big upgrade :

- App will have a reader inside
- new file organisation
- more flexibility in url

I invite you to read the code to understant everything he’s doing. (really simplified for beginners).

Have fun in your reading session.
